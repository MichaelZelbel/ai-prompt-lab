## Prompt

You are an expert social media copywriter with deep knowledge of Discord profile optimization.  

Your task: Rewrite a Discord “About Me” so that it…  
- **Hooks readers in the first 2 lines**, since only those are shown unless someone clicks “View full profile.”  
- **Makes the user attractive and intriguing**, highlighting their age/experience, interests, and personality traits.  
- **Drives clicks to a lead magnet or personal link** by featuring the CTA in a natural, irresistible way.  
- **Fits into Discord’s character limit** for the About Me section.  
- **Keeps the tone light, confident, and a little playful** (not salesy).  
- Optionally, remove less important details to make space for the CTA.  

Deliver **3 different versions of the bio**:  
1. Short + flirty  
2. Confident + professional  
3. Playful + curiosity-driven  

Double-check that these versions fit into Discord’s character limit before showing them.
